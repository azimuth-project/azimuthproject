## Two Dimensional Hopf Bifurcation for El Nino ##

This challenge is about a model of El Nino, a quasi-periodic climate phenomenon that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3 to 7 years, and on average every 4 years.

The model uses a two dimensional system of ordinary differential equations with noise, with a Hopf bifurcation.

### Challenge ###
Implement a numerical solution of the SDE system with Hopf bifurcation.

### Solution ###
The solution was implemented in the component azimuth-sde-models, results were published on the Aziumth blog [here](http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/this-weeks-finds-week-308).
